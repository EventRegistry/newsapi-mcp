              - text: A concept is an annotation that can be assigned to an article, story or event. Concepts can represent entities (people, locations, organizations) or non-entities/keywords (things such as table, personal computer, toy, robot, ...). All concepts have a unique ID called

              - text: . Each concept can have various properties, such as labels in different languages, synonyms, image and description. Concepts are very important since they allow you to search for things based on the thing itself and not using a keyword. For example, if you want to find all articles that mention White House, you can't use the keyword "White House" to find articles in Spanish, since there it is written as "Casa Blanca". If you use the concept URI for White House (

              - text: ) you can, however, retrieve mentions of White House in all languages.
            - paragraph [ref=e5436]: As mentioned, concepts are assigned to articles, stories, and events. A concept is associated with the article if it is mentioned in it. There is also a score assigned to the mentioned concept which is in the range between 1 (the concept is not very relevant for the article) and 5 (the concept is very relevant for the article). Similarly, a concept can be associated with a story or event. Stories and events are assigned concepts that are common in the containing articles. The score assigned to the concepts, in this case, represents the importance of the concept for the story/event and can be in the range 0 - 100.

            - paragraph [ref=e5439]: In order to get concept's URI for a given label, you can use the utility method "EventRegistry.getConceptUri()". In case the method returns None you have to perform the search using the label as a keyword.
